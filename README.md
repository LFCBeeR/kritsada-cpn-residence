Hello, my name is Kritsada Wuthanusorn, and this is the git repository for the CPN_Residence Coding Assessment.

All the code I'm working on is on Replit. If you have a Replit account, I recommend you remix my code to view and try running it.

My Replit => https://replit.com/@LFCBeeR/kritsada-cpn-residence?v=1

Or if you'd like to try it out in a real-world test, you can go to this link => https://kritsada-cpn-residence.replit.app
